# intro-section-with-dropdown  

   This project is a challenge from the [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5) website.  
   
I choose this especific project as a way of studying and learning more about JavaScript forms of interactions that can be applied to a form  
as well as understanding more about inputs stylization, hover and active atributes, background image manipulation, font size manipulation and HTML tag semantics.
